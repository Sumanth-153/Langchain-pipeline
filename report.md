# LangChain Pipeline Project Report

## 1. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to understand how LangChain can be used to build structured AI workflows by connecting prompt templates, language models, and output parsers.

## 2. Environment Setup
- Installed Python 3.x
- Created a virtual environment using venv
- Activated the virtual environment
- Installed required dependencies using pip

## 3. Project Structure
The project contains four main files:
- README.md: Project overview
- hello_langchain.py: LangChain pipeline code
- requirements.txt: Dependency list
- report.md: Project documentation

## 4. LangChain Pipeline Design
- A prompt template was created to define structured input
- An OpenAI chat model interface was initialized
- An output parser was added to format responses
- All components were connected using LangChain's pipe architecture

## 5. Execution and Validation
The pipeline was executed in a local environment. Due to API quota limitations, live model execution was skipped, but pipeline creation and structure were successfully validated.

## 6. Outcome
The project successfully demonstrates how to design and validate a modular LangChain pipeline suitable for building AI workflows and agent-based systems.
