# LangChain Pipeline Demo

This project demonstrates the creation of a modern LangChain pipeline using Python. It shows how a prompt template can be connected to an LLM interface and an output parser to form a reusable AI workflow. The project focuses on pipeline structure, modular design, and execution readiness in a real development environment.
